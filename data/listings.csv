For the time and efforts it takes us to render this assistance to you we charge a fee which starts at a minimum of $800

To obtain a quote and estimate based on your needs please contact us at show contact info

Some examples of people we have assisted in the past are: Young adults new to renting/first time moving out, relocations (corporate or personal) from overseas and interprovincial, executives and busy individuals that simply don’t have the time investment that goes into the process of finding a rental, new immigrants, international students, tenants with pets, short term accommodations, and room shares.

Since offering this service we are consistently receiving positive feedback from all of our clients as there is generally a lack of available resources to assist tenants. Unlike rental agents, property managers and realtors that are hired and work for landlords, we as personal assistants protect the interests of tenants by making sure we find the most optimal available rental unit/home for their needs and wants.

Located in the DTES and historic Chinatown, please look up the address and be aware of the neighborhood. This is a vibrant neighborhood to say the least. Close to everything that downtown Vancouver has to offer restaurants, pubs, parks, Rogers Arena within walking distance. There is parking so you have the freedom to drive in and out of the parking garage.

DETAILS:
*I have a WA2 filtration system installed at the kitchen sink. Never buy plastic bottles again.*
*The unit did not have a closet so I added a custom closet system from Ikea.
(Absolutely love the closet but was unable to move it LOL)
*Parking stall included right beside the elevator and is double gated underground for security.

*Views of the North Shore Mountains.

*Damage Deposit - Half Months Rent $850
*6 month to 1-year lease then month to month after

*Damage Deposit is also required the building key FOB, unit keys, parking garage keys and storage room keys and will be returned when you move out.

I would prefer a long term tenant.

FYI: The condo is located in the Downtown Eastside and its a unique and colorful neighborhood. Please be advised that people are shooting up drugs outside and we are located across the street from the Insite injection clinic. That being said, I am able to walk around without any issues. I am aware of my surroundings at all times. For the most part, you are left alone. Also, my unit has an underground parking spot, so if you drive you can safely come and go at your leisure.

Some examples of people we have assisted in the past are: Young adults new to renting/first time moving out, relocations (corporate or personal) from overseas and interprovincial, executives and busy individuals that simply don’t have the time investment that goes into the process of finding a rental, new immigrants, international students, tenants with pets, short term accommodations, and room shares.

Since offering this service we are consistently receiving positive feedback from all of our clients as there is generally a lack of available resources to assist tenants. Unlike rental agents, property managers and realtors that are hired and work for landlords, we as personal assistants protect the interests of tenants by making sure we find the most optimal available rental unit/home for their needs and wants.

For the time and efforts it takes us to render this assistance to you we charge a fee which starts at a minimum of $800

To obtain a quote and estimate based on your needs please contact us at show contact info

Some examples of people we have assisted in the past are: Young adults new to renting/first time moving out, relocations (corporate or personal) from overseas and interprovincial, executives and busy individuals that simply don’t have the time investment that goes into the process of finding a rental, new immigrants, international students, tenants with pets, short term accommodations, and room shares.

Since offering this service we are consistently receiving positive feedback from all of our clients as there is generally a lack of available resources to assist tenants. Unlike rental agents, property managers and realtors that are hired and work for landlords, we as personal assistants protect the interests of tenants by making sure we find the most optimal available rental unit/home for their needs and wants.
