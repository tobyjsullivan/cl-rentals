For the time and efforts it takes us to render this assistance to you we charge a fee which starts at a minimum of $800

To obtain a quote and estimate based on your needs please contact us at show contact info

Some examples of people we have assisted in the past are: Young adults new to renting/first time moving out, relocations (corporate or personal) from overseas and interprovincial, executives and busy individuals that simply don’t have the time investment that goes into the process of finding a rental, new immigrants, international students, tenants with pets, short term accommodations, and room shares.

Since offering this service we are consistently receiving positive feedback from all of our clients as there is generally a lack of available resources to assist tenants. Unlike rental agents, property managers and realtors that are hired and work for landlords, we as personal assistants protect the interests of tenants by making sure we find the most optimal available rental unit/home for their needs and wants.

For the time and efforts it takes us to render this assistance to you we charge a fee which starts at a minimum of $800

To obtain a quote and estimate based on your needs please contact us at show contact info

Some examples of people we have assisted in the past are: Young adults new to renting/first time moving out, relocations (corporate or personal) from overseas and interprovincial, executives and busy individuals that simply don’t have the time investment that goes into the process of finding a rental, new immigrants, international students, tenants with pets, short term accommodations, and room shares.

Since offering this service we are consistently receiving positive feedback from all of our clients as there is generally a lack of available resources to assist tenants. Unlike rental agents, property managers and realtors that are hired and work for landlords, we as personal assistants protect the interests of tenants by making sure we find the most optimal available rental unit/home for their needs and wants.
